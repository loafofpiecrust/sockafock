# Sock A Fock
A simple SOCKS5 proxy server written in Rust with minimal dependencies.
To test text replacement, currently attempts to switch English pronouns He and She, so all instances of 'he', ignoring case, in the server response, are replaced with 'She'. The opposite with instance of 'she', ignoring case.
